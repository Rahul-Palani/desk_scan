# How to Run Desk Scanner After Restarting Your Computer

1. **Open Terminal**

2. **Navigate to your project folder:**
   ```sh
   cd ~/Desktop/desk_scan
   ```

3. **(Optional) Activate your Python virtual environment:**
   If you use a virtual environment, activate it:
   ```sh
   source desk_scan/.venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. **Start the FastAPI backend server:**
   ```sh
   uvicorn server:app --reload
   ```
   Leave this terminal window open.

5. **Open a new Terminal tab/window**

6. **Start the frontend server:**
   ```sh
   cd ~/Desktop/desk_scan/frontend
   python3 -m http.server 8080
   ```
   Leave this terminal window open.

7. **Open your browser and go to:**
   [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

8. **(Optional) To capture new notes/images:**
   - Open a new Terminal tab/window
   - Run:
     ```sh
     cd ~/Desktop/desk_scan
     python3 main.py
     ```
   - Use the camera window to capture new notes.

**Troubleshooting:**
- If you see blank notes, make sure both servers are running and you are using `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.
- If you get errors about missing Python packages, install them with:
  ```sh
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- If you have camera issues, check macOS privacy settings and close other apps using the camera.

**You must repeat these steps every time you restart your computer.**
